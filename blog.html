                Put as much effort as you want,<br>
        But there'll always be a piece missing of your puzzle,<br>
       A forever chasing ghost that will possess you and haunt,<br>
    Desire, is the name of that wild on which no one can ever put a muzzle.<br>

Roots want to reach out to the core,<br>
Clouds and birds want to reach out to the sun,<br>
Rainbow's not satisfied with the spectrum, it wants more . <br>
Plants and trees wish they could jump and run . <br>
Ocean wishes more water,<br>
Land wishes more parts , may be a quarter.<br>

Some have got everything they want ,<br>
But their pot is never gonna fill up ,<br>
Some wish they had parents, that's all they want,<br>
While some want to get rid of those who gave them birth.<br>
Many want to fill a cave full of currency notes,<br>
While many struggle everyday to get those life boats.<br>

May be the emojis want to come alive ,<br>
The paper plane wants to fly up to space ,<br>
      May be the balloon wants to go scuba dive,<br>
    Snowman wants to enjoy summer with a red face .<br>

  Everyone out there may be living or non- living,<br>
         Has an incomplete part of itself,<br>
    A door which opens up to endless doors,<br>
A never ending road called unfulfilled desire ,an alarm that always keeps ringing.   </p>
